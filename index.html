<h1>Hola!</h1>

<p>My name is Dennis Erny and I am a Senior Front-end Engineer based in the beautiful city of Toronto, Canada.</p>

<p>Since 2012, I've been lucky enough to work on over a dozen exciting enterprise Web Applications and Web Sites, as both an agency contractor and full time employee.</p>


<!-- Image Sprite -->

<p>My focus at the moment is on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AngularJS 1.x application development with a mind towards 'thin controllers' and a path towards less painful 2.0 migration.</li>
  <li>Building modular Web components that leverage Angular Directives, Sass and BEM naming conventions.</li>
  <li>UI Design and vector logo design with Adobe Illustrator and live mobile/desktop mock-ups using cloud-based tools such as UXPin.</li>
  <li>Continuous Integration using Jenkins in concert with Grunt, Jasmine, Karma and friends.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Reuze</h1>

<p>Back by popular demand: my minimal blog-centric framework, Reuze, is back from the dead.</p>

<p>You can now access the HTML builder at: <a href="http://derny.github.io/reuze">derny.github.io/reuze</a>. The core CSS (less than 10KB) is still available at <a href="https://github.com/derny/reuze">github.com/derny/reuze</a>.
