title: Reuze Is Back!
---

Back by popular demand: my minimal blog-centric framework, Reuze, is back from the dead.

You can now access the HTML builder at: [derny.github.io/reuze](http://derny.github.io/reuze). The core CSS (less than 10KB) is still available at [github.com/derny/reuze](https://github.com/derny/reuze).

Look for some updates to the framework coming in the next few months, including, support for [Jekyll blogs](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) -- just like this one!
