Greetings, my name is Dennis Erny and I am a Senior Front-end Engineer based in the beautiful city of Toronto, Canada.

My focus at the moment is on:

* AngularJS 1.x application development with a mind towards 'thin controllers' and a path towards less painful 2.0 migration.
* Building modular Web components that leverage Angular Directives, Sass and BEM naming conventions.
* UI Design and vector logo design with Adobe Illustrator and live mobile/desktop mock-ups using cloud-based tools such as UXPin.
* Continuous Integration using Jenkins in concert with Grunt, Jasmine, Karma and friends.
