Greetings, my name is Dennis Erny and I am a Senior Front-end Engineer based in the beautiful city of Toronto, Canada.

My focus at the moment is on:

* AngularJS 1.x application development with a mind towards 'thin controllers' and a path towards less painful 2.0 migration.
* Building modular Web components that leverage Angular Directives, Sass and BEM naming conventions.
* UI Design and vector logo design with Adobe Illustrator and live mobile/desktop mock-ups using cloud-based tools such as UXPin.
* Continuous Integration using Jenkins in concert with Grunt, Jasmine, Karma and friends.

## My Blog

One of my resolutions for 2015 is to share some of the things I have learned while working on enterprise-level AngularJS projects as a lead UI designer/developer.

Articles will center on my quest to build modular UI components for large-scale projects using Angular Directives combined with Block-Element Modifier (BEM) syntax for CSS.

Now, of course there are times when it makes sense to reach for frameworks such as [Angular Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/). My blog is for those who want to learn how to build component libraries that are a fraction of the size -- tailor-made to fit the needs of your particular client or employer. It's why they are paying you the big-bucks, right?

You certainly don't have to be an Angular Ninja to follow along, but, a solid understanding of the basics surrounding Angular and front-end development in general is going to be helpful.

So, won't you join me? Articles will begin to show up late January.
